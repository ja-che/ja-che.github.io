== About me
I am currently a post-doc in Machine Learning at Inria Saclay Île-de-France. Following my PhD. research, I am lucky to work under the supervision of [https://pages.saclay.inria.fr/bertrand.thirion/ Bertrand Thirion] and [http://josephsalmon.eu/ Joseph Salmon]. \n
My research focus on handling uncertainty in the challenging context of high dimensional regression problem. The primary field of application is neuro-imaging.

During my PhD., I had the chance to be a member of the [https://team.inria.fr/parietal/ parietal team] of the [https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-saclay-ile-de-france Inria Saclay-Île-de-France Research Centre]. \n
I am thankfull to the [https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/en/Pages/research_entities/NeuroSpin.aspx NeuroSpin Research Center] and to [https://www.telecom-paris.fr/ Telecom Paris] for hosting me during the thesis, allowing a better collaboration with my supervisors. \n
I am also thankfull to the [https://digicosme.cnrs.fr/en/digicosme-paris-saclay-english/ Labex Digicosme] and to the [https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/ Université Paris-Saclay] who funded my thesis.


Before my PhD., I graduated from [https://crl.u-paris.fr/ Université Paris-Diderot] and [https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/ ENSEIRB-MATMECA]. \n
More information about my background can be found on my [\/files/pdf/cv.pdf resume].

== Research Interests
Though I am interested in Machine Learning and Statistics in general, my main interests are statistical methods in high dimension, clustering methods and ensembling methods.

I also enjoy to code in Python on open source projects: I am one of the lead developers of [https://ja-che.github.io/hidimstat/ HiDimStat] that provides high-dimensional statistical inference tools and a contributor of [https://nilearn.github.io/ Nilearn] which is a reference package for the analysis of fMRI data.

To benefit from feedbacks from the Machine Learning and neuro-scientific community, I have published several papers in conferences and journals, my publications are all available [research.html here].
